# banana-production

This project explores the banana production network in Ecuador.

Firm-level data representing the banana production network are stored as nodelist, edgelist, and graphml files.

- They are extracted using the filtering interface in *ec_visualisation_app*, that connects to *database.duckdb* created by *ec_pipeline* and copied here inside "*data/*".
