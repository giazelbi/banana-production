# Pending analyses and improvements

## Issues/bugs

- database.duckdb still has the crazy e+12 link between two personas naturales

## Possible directions

### Trade

- Elaborate "ND" in edgelist. Validate with trade data (international import)?

### Industry resolution, or product granularity

- How much approximation are we introducing by using "*A0122 - Growing of tropical and subtropical fruits (avocados, bananas, dates, ...)*" instead of "*Growing of bananas*""? We can quantifing this by comparing the trade of bananas and aggregated tropical fruits. Or use the LUIcube data and compare the harvested mass.
